# Analysis-Intervention-Step-Function
This is my final project in university. In this repository, we talk about how can we predict the time series data while in the data there is an intervention that effects on several time spans.
I'm using BBRI Stock's price data that was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The data timeline is starting in 2017 and ending in 2021. When the covid came in 2020 it is already effected the data by pandemic.
So I predicted the data in 2022 by the data time series from 2017 2021. The prediction that we got is the data is about to rebound in 2021 and will be normally again in 2022.
